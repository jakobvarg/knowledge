There are several key differences between lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python, which help you distinguish between them:

Structure:

List: Ordered collection of elements, enclosed in square brackets []. Can contain duplicates.
Tuple: Ordered collection of elements, enclosed in parentheses (). Immutable (cannot be changed after creation). Can contain duplicates.
Set: Unordered collection of unique elements, enclosed in curly braces {}. Cannot contain duplicates.
Dictionary: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers), values can be any type.
Mutability:

List: Mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after creation.
Tuple: Immutable, meaning elements cannot be changed after creation.
Set: Mutable, you can add or remove elements, but duplicates are automatically removed.
Dictionary: Mutable, you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs.
Common Operations:

List: Accessing elements by index, slicing, iterating over elements.
Tuple: Accessing elements by index, slicing, iterating over elements.
Set: Checking membership, testing for sub/supersets, union, intersection, difference.
Dictionary: Accessing values by keys, iterating over key-value pairs, checking for keys.
Choosing the right data structure:

Use lists when you need an ordered collection with duplicates allowed and the ability to modify it.
Use tuples when you need an ordered collection that cannot be changed after creation.
Use sets when you need a collection of unique elements and efficient membership testing.
Use dictionaries when you need to associate data with unique keys for fast retrieval.
